# Landing Page
The Landing Page is the eye-opener to the website. Its the first thing people look at when they enter the page. So i made the page as eye catching as possible. Giving it a fitness background to show people that OneZone is a Fitness page. I placed text with a motivivating sentence to entice people to keep looking through.

# About Us
The about us page has one simple paragraph which is effectively the sales pitch for the audience. Giving them all the answers they need and ending with a rhetorical question for them to think about. Which will help them join the team by including the audience. Along with that it has a video on a loop of a little insite of what people do at our gym.

# Learn more
The learn more has a simple paragraph with two buttons. The membership and classes button. This pushes the audience to learn more about the classes and memberships giving it a clickable button to allow them to find out more.

# Classes
On the Classes Page there are three classes you can pick from. if the audience hovers over the picture it tells them what the class is and what time it starts. Not only that it has a button for them to book the class, if they would like to join.

# Contact Form
Theres a contact form where if people have questions before joining our gym then they can fill in a contact form or if they are already part of the team but dont feel comfortable approaching us, they are more than welcome to fil the form out.

# Memberships
There are three memberships for people to choose from. All have there perks to which will entice people to be part of the team. The perks i feel are a lot better then what most gyms have to offer as i feel like they're too basic. Offering better perks will catch peoples eyes.

# Unfixed Bugs
The Classes and Memberships buttons, you click just a little above the text, which i feel for me needs to be fixed to not confuse others.
